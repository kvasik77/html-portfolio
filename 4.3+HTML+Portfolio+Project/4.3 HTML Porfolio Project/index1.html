<h1>TOP BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO VLADA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>
Considering the fact that it is considered one of the cringiest movies of all the entire time it has a sense of nostalgia of old movies 
</p>
<h3>The Twilight Saga : New Moon</h3>
<p>
Despite its slow pace, relentless downcast tone and excessive length (as according to the critics), the fans such as me are happy nevertheless with how the movie met 
</p>
<h3>The twilight Saga : Eclipse</h3>
<p>
The unfotunate overly reliant uninspired dialgoue that is stuffed into this movie makes it nearly unwatchable. But it does have a good blend of romance and action fantasy in the plot.
